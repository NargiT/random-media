random-media
============

Random media (images, dynamic images, video, text) from a static list of web site like 9gag, lovingcode, fml and so on...

The point is to provide an implementation for each of this site and return the link of the media.
The tool will take care of displaying after loading it so the user will not experiment laggy effect.

 Status: in progress.
